;; This starter file contains one data definition, and then has two separate
;; function designs you must complete.  Both functions operate on the same
;; data definition, so this will save you time because you just have to learn
;; one data definition to design two functions.
;;
;; HINT: One of the problems in this file involves the try-catch template.
;;       Be sure that you use the template and the @template origin properly.
