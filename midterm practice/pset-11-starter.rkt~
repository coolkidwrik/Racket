;; boxes. It is asking how many routes have TF as their destination (how many
;; arrows are pointing to TF).
;;
;; Examples:
;;
;; (num-lead-to TA TI) produces 3. This is because there are three routes that
;; are reachable from TA that lead to TI. These routes are the route leading
;; from TH to TI, the route leading from TJ to TI, and the route leading from

;;
;; Note that you can use the built-in function equal? to compare if two
;; treasures are equal. For example:
;;   - (equal? TE TF) produces false
;;   - (equal? TB TB) produces true
