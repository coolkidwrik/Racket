(@cwl ???)   ;fill in your CWL here (same CWL you put for 110 problem sets)

(@problem 1) ;THIS IS REALLY PROBLEM 6.  DO NOT EDIT OR DELETE THIS LINE!

;;
;; Design a function called tree that consumes a positive number and
;; produces a fractal image like the ones shown in the exam supplement
;;     http://cs110.students.cs.ubc.ca/exams/trees.pdf
;;
;; To save writing we are giving you a simple function called tr that consumes
;; a number and produces a black solid rectangle of width 1 and that height.
;; This will save you having to write "rectangle", "solid", and COLOR multiple
;; times.
;;
;; You must include all relevant design recipe elements, including a three part
;; termination argument.
;;

;; As always, a file that does not run will lose a significant number of marks.
;; Run your work often, so that you can check and fix errors as soon as they
;; creep in.  Also be sure to run every time before you submit.
