;;     Remember this, it is what you will do with these @cwl annotations

;;   - A UBC Extended Learning student, replace the first set of ??? with
;;     the your email address as confirmed in the email you received from
;;     extended learning.  The handin password is also in that email.

;; - (cons "R" Path)
;; interp. 
;;  A sequence of left and right 'turns' down through a binary tree
;;  (list "L" "R" "R") means take the left child of the root, then
;;  the right child of that node, and the right child again.
;;  empty means you have arrived at the destination.
