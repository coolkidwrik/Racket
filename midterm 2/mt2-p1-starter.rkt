(@cwl wriksen)   ;fill in your CWL here (same CWL you put for 110 problem sets)

#|

For this problem you will be working with the type comments and arrows
shown in the handout or:

  https://cs110.students.cs.ubc.ca/exams/2021w1-mt2/mt2-p1-figure.pdf


ERRORS AND FAILING TESTS

A file that does not run without errors will receive zero marks.  At this point
in the course there is no reason for you to hand in a file that does not run.
Run your work often while building the templates and filling in the arrows
constant and you should have no problem being sure your file runs. Also be sure
to run EVERY TIME BEFORE YOU SUBMIT.

We have special checks (tests) at the end of the file.	Any tests that fail
indicate that you have not understood or followed the instructions on how to
form your answer.  Files that have failing checks may earn as few as zero marks.
IF YOU GET A FAILING CHECK, take the time to CAREFULLY READ THE MESSAGE.  We
have designed these tests so that the name of the failing tests indicates what 
is incorrect.

If you get more than one error or failing test we recommend fixing the first
one and then re-running before trying to fix the later ones.
