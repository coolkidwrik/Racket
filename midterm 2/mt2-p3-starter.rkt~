(@cwl ???)   ;fill in your CWL here (same CWL you put for 110 problem sets)

(@problem 1) ;this is actually problem 3 - DO NOT EDIT OR DELETE THIS LINE!

#|

 Complete the design of the following function by writing the template tag
 and the function definition.  NOTE:
  - Your function MUST use built-in abstract functions. 
  - Your function MUST NOT be recursive.
  - Any answer that includes any part of the recursive Natural
    template or the (listof X) template will receive 0 marks. 
    In particular do not submit code like (cond [(zero? ... 
    or (cond [(empty? ... 
  - For full marks it must be a composition of exactly 2 different
    built-in abstract functions.
  - You must NOT change any check-expects, but you are free to add new ones.
