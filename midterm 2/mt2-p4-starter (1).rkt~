(@problem 1) ;this is actually problem 1 - DO NOT EDIT OR DELETE THIS LINE!

(define COLOR "black")
(define CUTOFF 50)	; Minimum size

#|
In this problem you must complete the design of a function to draw escher
squares.  You must use the COLOR and CUTOFF constants in your tests and
function definition.  You must also use the helper function one-quarter
in your solution.

As this is a genrec problem be sure to include a 3 part termination
argument.

See the handout or this PDF file for an explanation of Escher squares.

;; ----------------------
;; Below is a function which you should treat as a primitive.  As such we are
;; only giving you signature, purpose, and the function definition.  We suggest
;; you start by running the program and then type  (one-quarter 20)  in the
;; definitions window.  You will see that this function gives you 1/4 of the
;; basic image for any given size of escher square.

(@signature Natural -> Image)
;; produces 1/4 of the base image for an escher square of size l
(define (one-quarter l)
  (overlay (square l "outline" "black")
           (overlay/align

                    (isosceles-triangle (* .5 (sqrt (* 2 (sqr l))))
